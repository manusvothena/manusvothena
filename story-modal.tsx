      "Tiny awoke with a gasp, heart pounding against fragile ribs. The nightmare clung like cobwebs, fragments of terror dissolving even as small hands clutched at them. Something about falling. Something about a sky shattering like glass. Something about being utterly, completely alone. But the details were already fading, leaving only the residue of fear. Tiny blinked, eyes adjusting to soft, ambient light. Above, a canopy of luminescent leaves swayed gently, casting rippling patterns across what appeared to be a massive trunk. Tiny was nestled in a hollow at the base of an enormous tree, cushioned by a bed of moss that seemed to pulse with gentle light in response to movement. \"Hello?\" The word emerged as a whisper, uncertain and small.",
      "No answer came except the soft rustling of leaves and a distant, melodic sound that might have been wind through branches or might have been something singing. Tiny sat up slowly, wincing at unexpected soreness. Looking down revealed a small body clad in simple garments that seemed woven from moonlight and shadow. No injuries were visible, yet everything ached as if from a great fall. \"Where am I?\" Tiny asked the empty air, voice a little stronger now. Again, no answer came from the strange, luminous forest. Standing proved difficult but manageable. The moss beneath bare feet felt cool and somehow supportive, as if it were consciously cushioning each step. Tiny moved cautiously to the edge of the hollow and peered out.",
      "A vast dreamscape stretched in all directions. The tree that had sheltered Tiny was just one of many colossal giants, their trunks wider than houses, their canopies lost in misty heights above. Between them flowed streams of what looked like liquid starlight, pooling in glowing ponds that reflected impossible constellations. Flowers that resembled crystal bells chimed softly in a breeze that carried scents of cinnamon and ozone. In the distance, floating islands drifted lazily through banks of luminous fog, trailing gardens that hung like the beards of sky-bound mountains. It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It was utterly unfamiliar. Tiny slumped back against the trunk of the great tree, suddenly overwhelmed."
    ],
    [
      "The questions came in a rush: Where was this place? How had Tiny arrived here? Why couldn't Tiny remember anything before the nightmare? Was there anyone else here? Anyone who might help? And beneath those questions, a deeper, more troubling one: Who was Tiny? There should be memories, a history, a sense of self beyond just existing in this moment. But trying to recall anything before awakening in the hollow yielded nothing but a sense of vertigo and echoes of that same nightmare. Falling. A shattering sky. Absolute solitude.",
      "A soft sound interrupted the spiral of questions. Something between a chime and a whisper, coming from further around the massive tree trunk. Tiny hesitated, then followed the sound, moving carefully around the circumference of the enormous tree. On the other side, nestled among roots that rose taller than Tiny's head, sat a small glass fishbowl containing a single goldfish. The fishbowl emitted a soft glow, and the goldfish inside swam in lazy circles, its scales catching the light with each movement. Each time the fish completed a circle, the bowl produced that chime-whisper sound. Tiny knelt beside it, heart racing with unexpected recognition. This fishbowl, this fishâ€”they felt familiar in a way nothing else had since awakening."
